Please read this!

Before opening a new pull request (PR), make sure you are merging to the main branch, have your GitHub Issue ID (GID), and understand the popular Git Category Flags (GCF). This will guide the creation of a perfect PR.

Here are examples of a GID and GCF.
- GID: #<ID>, where ID represents a GitHub Issue ID; e.g., #1
- GCF: breaking, build, ci, chore, docs, feat, fix, other, perf, refactor, revert, style, test, dependency.

The following section guide MUST be adhered to when creating an PR:
1. Title: This must include your primary GCF followed by a colon and a general summary of your changes in lowercase. E.g., "feat: owner role functionalities"
2. Labels: This must include a label similar to your primary GCF.
3. Body: You must follow the PR template without removing any section, even if it is empty.
4. Reviewer: You must assign '@emmanuelJet' to the PR for code review.
5. Assignee: You must include yourself as the PR assignee.
6. Project: You should select a related repo project when available for your PR.

If you have any questions or need further assistance, feel free to reach out in the comments or contact '@emmanuelJet'.
