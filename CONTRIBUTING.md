# Contributing to MultiSigEnterpriseVault

Thank you for considering contributing to MultiSigEnterpriseVault! I welcome contributions from the community and am excited to work with you.

## How to Contribute

### Reporting Bugs

- Ensure the bug was not already reported by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/emmanuelJet/MultiSigEnterpriseVault/issues).
- If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, open a new one. Be sure to include a title and clear description, as much relevant information as possible, and a code sample or an executable test case demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.
- When opening a new issue, select the appropriate template that best matches your report (e.g., [Bug Report](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug-report.md)).

### Suggesting Enhancements

- Search the existing [Issues](https://github.com/emmanuelJet/MultiSigEnterpriseVault/issues) for enhancement suggestions to avoid duplicates.
- If you find a related issue, feel free to add your thoughts and suggestions.
- If you don't find an existing issue, open a new one and describe the enhancement in detail.
- Use the provided template for [feature requests](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature-implementation.md) to ensure all necessary information is included.

### Submitting Pull Requests

- Fork the repository and create your branch from `main`.
- If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
- Ensure the test suite passes.
- Make sure your code lints.
- Use the [pull request template](.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md) to ensure all necessary information is included.
- Follow the checklist in the template to verify that your pull request meets the project requirements.
- Issue that pull request!

## Code Style

- Follow the existing code style and use `forge fmt` to format your code.
- Document all functions using [NatSpec comments](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.20/natspec-format.html).
- Write clear, concise commit messages.

## Branch Naming Guidelines

To keep a clean and understandable Git history, always base new branches off the `main` branch and follow these branch naming conventions:

- Feature Branches: For new features use: `feat/<feature-name>`
  - Example: feat/owner-role
- Enhancement Branches: For existing feature enhancements or improvements use: `perf/<enhancement-description>`
  - Example: perf/owner-access
- Bug Fixes: For bug fixes, use: `fix/<issue-description>`
  - Example: fix/gas-estimation
- Chores or Refactoring: For maintenance or refactoring tasks, use: `chore/<task-description>`
  - Example: chore/update-dependencies

## Commit Message Guidelines

To maintain a clean and readable commit history, follow these guidelines:

- Use Conventional Commits: Format your commit messages as follows:

  ```txt
  <type>: <short summary>
  ```

  Examples:
  - feat: signer role functionality
  - fix: gas estimation bug
- Types of Commits:
  - feat: A new feature
  - fix: A bug fix
  - perf: A feature enhancement
  - docs: Documentation-only changes
  - test: Adding or updating tests
  - chore: Routine tasks like refactoring or updating dependencies

## Community

- Follow best practices for collaboration, and ensure tests are written for all new code.
- Be respectful and considerate in your communication.
- Follow the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
